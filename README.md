# MiB-NIRS-MuscleOxigenation
A firmware application for real-time monitoring of muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics during gait analysis. This system integrates the AD MAX30101 optical sensor with the STM32F303K8 microcontroller to provide accurate NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) measurements for biomechanical analysis.

## Overview

This project implements Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring using the MAX30101 pulse oximetry and heart rate sensor integrated with the STM32F303K8 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.

## Hardware

- **Microcontroller**: STM32F303K8
- **Optical Sensor**: AD MAX30101 (pulse oximetry, heart rate, SpO2)
- **Communication**: I2C interface
