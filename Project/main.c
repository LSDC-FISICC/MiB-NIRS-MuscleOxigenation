/**
 * @brief System initialization and main control loop
 * @details Initializes all peripherals in sequence:
 *          1. **Clock**: PLL to 64 MHz (HSI 8 MHz × 16)
 *          2. **GPIO**: Status LED on PB3 (push-pull output)
 *          3. **I2C1**: 400 kHz fast-mode on PB6 (SCL), PB7 (SDA)
 *          4. **Sensor**: MAX30101 NIRS Lite mode — Red + IR at 50 Hz, 1.6 mA each
 *          5. **UART**: USART2 at 460800 baud (PA2=TX, PA15=RX)
 *          6. **Timer**: SysTick at 50 Hz (20 ms period), enabling the acquisition ISR
 *
 *          After initialization, the main loop waits for data_ready (set by SysTick ISR)
 *          and transmits each Red/IR sample pair over UART as a CSV string.
 *          All sensor acquisition runs in the ISR; main only handles transmission.
 *
 * @param None
 * @return int - Never returns (infinite loop)
 * @note Initialization order is critical: I2C must be configured before MAX30101,
 *       and UART before SysTick to avoid transmitting before the port is ready.
 * @warning Enabling SysTick (last step) immediately arms the ISR. Any initialization
 *          that must complete before the first ISR fires should precede SysTick_Config().
 * @execution
 *   - Blocking operations during init: PLL lock (~few µs), I2C configuration
 *   - Time to first ISR: ~20 ms after SysTick_Config()
 * @see clk_config, LED_config, I2C1_Config, MAX30101_InitNIRSLite, SysTick_Handler
 * @example
 *   // After init, main loop outputs one line per sample at 50 Hz:
 *   // "1234.567,2345.678\r\n"  (Red nA, IR nA)

/**
 * @brief SysTick Timer Interrupt Service Routine (20 ms period)
 * @details Core real-time data acquisition routine:
 *          1. Queries MAX30101 FIFO for available samples
 *          2. If samples available: reads one sample and converts to nanoamps
 *          3. Advances FIFO read pointer and signals main loop via data_ready flag
 *          4. Toggles status LED (visual heartbeat)
 *
 *          This ISR runs non-preemptively (highest priority) every 20 milliseconds,
 *          synchronized with the MAX30101 output data rate (50 Hz). In steady state,
 *          exactly one sample is available per interrupt.
 *
 * @param None
 * @return void
 * @note ISR Context
 *       - Execution time: ~1–2 ms (I2C reads dominate; ~0.5 ms per transaction)
 *       - Called at SysTick interrupt (cannot nest itself)
 *       - All registers preserved; no clobbering of main loop state
 *
 * @data_output
 *       Upon samples available:
 *       - Populates MAX30101_NIRS_SingleCurrentSample (Red, IR fields in nanoamps)
 *       - Sets data_ready = 1 to signal main loop
 *       - Data valid until next ISR fires (~20 ms window)
 *
 * @timing
 *       - ISR rate: 50 Hz (20 ms period), matching MAX30101 ODR of 50 Hz
 *       - Steady state: exactly 1 sample per interrupt
 *       - At startup: up to 2 samples may be present before the first ISR fires;
 *         only the most recent is read, the pointer advances past all pending samples
 *       - Sample age at read: 0–20 ms depending on arrival time within the period
 *
 * @warning
 *       - data_ready is declared volatile so the compiler does not cache it in a
 *         register across the ISR boundary. Without volatile, -O1 or higher can
 *         optimize away the flag check in the main loop (undefined behavior in C).
 *       - I2C blocking: If I2C bus is busy, ISR execution may extend by several ms
 *
 * @see MAX30101_GetNumAvailableSamples, MAX30101_ReadSingleCurrentData, LED_Toggle
 * @example
 *   // ISR fires every 20 ms (50 Hz), synchronized to sensor output
 *   // MAX30101_NIRS_SingleCurrentSample updated with one fresh Red/IR nA pair
 *   // LED toggles each tick → 25 Hz blink (20 ms on, 20 ms off)
